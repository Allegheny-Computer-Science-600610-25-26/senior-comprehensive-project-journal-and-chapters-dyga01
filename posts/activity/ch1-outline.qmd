# Introduction

1. Introduction
	-  Introduce Vurze at a high level: automated decorator injection that embeds signatures into Python functions and classes so code can self-verify integrity and authorship
    - Introduce Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and their role in modern development
    - Brief introduction to security challenges in MCP server environments

2. Current State of the Art
	- Git for version control systems
    - Gap identification: lack of specialized MCP server security tools
    - Comparison with traditional API security approaches
    - Limitations of current solutions when applied to MCP servers

3. Motivation
    - Growing adoption of MCP servers in development workflows
    - Unique security challenges posed by MCP architecture
    - Need for specialized security tooling

4. Ethical Implications
    - Privacy considerations in MCP server interactions
    - Responsibility in securing developer-AI communications
    - Balancing security with accessibility and usability
    - Ethical considerations for AI-assisted development
