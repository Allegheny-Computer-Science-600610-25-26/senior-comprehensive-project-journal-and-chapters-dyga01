# Introduction

This research introduces a tool called Vurze. Vurze, short for “version control,” is a command-line tool that enforces cryptographic integrity for Python functions and classes by automatically injecting decorators. Each decorator is a cryptographic signature that represents the unerlying source code. To generate this signature, Vurze uses a private key along with the function’s source code. If even a single character in the code changes, the resulting signature will differ completely, allowing the detection of any unauthorized modifications.

At a high level, Vurze introduces a novel approach to source control by enabling code to version control other code. Instead of relying solely on external files that store version histories, Vurze embeds decorators directly within the source code itself. This per-entity approach is in some ways less complex than more advanced version control systems.


The Vurze tool provides simple command line interface (CLI) commands to initialize keys, add decorators, verify signatures, and remove decorators. by building this tool as a cli, the idea is that it is as flexible as possible.

The tool is intentionally lightweight and workflow-friendly. Its CLI, built with Typer, supports straightforward commands for initializing key pairs, decorating code, validating signatures, and removing decorators when needed. Under the hood, Vurze uses PyO3 and a Rust backend compiled via maturin to sign code using the Ed25519 signature scheme, balancing performance and portable cryptographic guarantees. Signatures are embedded as decorators, making verification possible at import or during static analysis without changing function semantics.

This document requires that you discuss the ethical implications of your work -- no
matter how benign you consider the outcome of your project. As several major studies
of ethical issues in computer science assert: _no project is completely value-neutral_.

To assist you in elaborating on these issues, the following areas are topics you might
consider addressing. You do not need to address all of them.

* Information Privacy
* Information Accuracy (e.g. can contain reliability)
* Potential Misuse (e.g. computer crime, unintended consequences)
* Second- or Third-Party Risk (e.g. safety)
* Data Collection Issues (e.g. issues inherent in collecting data)
* Algorithmic or Data Bias
* Potential Power Difference / Social Imbalance / Issues in Equity

In addition, reflect on ways that the above harms can be or are mitigated by your work.
