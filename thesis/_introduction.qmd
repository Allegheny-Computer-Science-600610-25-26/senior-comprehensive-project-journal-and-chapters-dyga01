# Introduction

This research introduces a tool called Vurze. Vurze, short for “version control,” is a command-line tool that enforces cryptographic integrity for Python functions and classes by automatically injecting decorators. Each decorator is a cryptographic signature that represents the unerlying source code. To generate this signature, Vurze uses a private key along with the function’s source code. If even a single character in the code changes, the resulting signature will differ completely, allowing the detection of any unauthorized modifications.

At a high level, Vurze introduces a novel approach to source control by enabling code to version-control other code. Instead of relying solely on external files that store version histories, Vurze embeds decorators directly within the source code itself. This per-entity approach is, in some ways, less complex than traditional version control systems and is designed to complement them. Traditional version control systems like Git rely on hidden files to record changes across an entire codebase. While this approach is highly effective for large-scale version management and collaboration, it treats code as a collection of files rather than individual, verifiable entities. Vurze complements this model by introducing built-in, function-level verification that provides an additional layer of security against unauthorized modifications.

The Vurze tool provides a simple command-line interface (CLI) with commands to initialize keys, add decorators, verify signatures, and remove decorators. The CLI is intentionally minimalist so it can be easily integrated into CI/CD pipelines, invoked as a pre-deployment check, or used within middleware. Vurze is built with both Python and Rust to combine Python’s flexibility with Rust’s performance and safety. Rust also offers robust built-in libraries for cryptography, making it an ideal foundation for secure and efficient code execution.

This document requires that you discuss the ethical implications of your work -- no
matter how benign you consider the outcome of your project. As several major studies
of ethical issues in computer science assert: _no project is completely value-neutral_.

To assist you in elaborating on these issues, the following areas are topics you might
consider addressing. You do not need to address all of them.

* Information Privacy
* Information Accuracy (e.g. can contain reliability)
* Potential Misuse (e.g. computer crime, unintended consequences)
* Second- or Third-Party Risk (e.g. safety)
* Data Collection Issues (e.g. issues inherent in collecting data)
* Algorithmic or Data Bias
* Potential Power Difference / Social Imbalance / Issues in Equity

In addition, reflect on ways that the above harms can be or are mitigated by your work.
